# Wilkommen

This is my portfolio website that I created using Django to showcase my projects and share more about myself.

## Projects

This portfolio features a variety of projects I've worked on, demonstrating my skills and expertise in different areas. Each project includes a brief description and links to more detailed information or the project repository.

## How to Run the Project

If you want to explore the website or run it on your own machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone or Download the Repository
2. Navigate to `myportfolio(root directory) -> myportfolio` (there are two folders with the same name).
3. Open the command prompt (CMD).
4. Run the following command to start the project:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

This command will start the development server, and you can view the website in your browser at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

Enjoy exploring my work and learning more about me!
