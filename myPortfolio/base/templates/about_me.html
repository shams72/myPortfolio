          Just another CS student here, piecing together a portfolio website to catch the eyes of recruiters.<br>My name's Shams, and 
          I've got roots in Bangladesh, but I spent my formative years soaking up the sun in Qatar. Back in Qatar, I kicked off my schooling in an Indian
          institution before making the leap to Germany.

        <p class="description anim3">
          Right now, I'm knee-deep in my CS degree at Darmstadt University of Applied Sciences, cruising through my fourth semester.        
          If you like what you see in my side projects and resume and think I'd be a good fit for your team, shoot me an email in my inbox.
