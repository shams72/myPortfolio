                As part of a university project, I developed a comprehensive application utilizing QtCreator. This application seamlessly 
                manages customer data, enabling seamless reading, insertion, and deletion of information stored in a JSON file.
                Booking an object within the system involves capturing essential customer details, and dynamically generating unique 
                identification for each booking. Additionally, the application integrates a map feature, offering customers a visual 
                representation of their journey from the starting point to their final destination.

                Just a side project.I was curious to understand how games are devloped.With the help of YouTube tutorials I developes a space and breakout game in C++ using QT Creator. 
                Implemented scoring systems and health checks for engaging gameplay experiences.

                In order to understand Java Programming Language,I felt the best way was to do through a prject.
                Using YouTube tutorials in my free time, I created a classic Snake game. It has scoring and health checks, 
                helping me to understand the basics through hands-on practice.

                As part of our Human-Computer Interaction university module, our team of four collaborated on developing a user-centric app. 
                We chose to create a To-Do app using Android Studio and Java, enriching it with user-driven features to enhance functionality
                and overall user experience.
